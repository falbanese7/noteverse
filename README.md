## Description

This repository contains the code for an application called Sitestash, where users can log into an account and securely and privately store bookmarks in a list format that can be saved for later, not tied to any external site. By 
creating an account, the user can access bookmarks from any web browser so thereâ€™s no need to import or export bookmarks if you decide to change your default browser and can access from anywhere on any device.

This website follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
